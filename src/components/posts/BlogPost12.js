      <div className='title-blog'>Eden Has No Walls: How Blockchain Brings AI to the Masses
</div>
      <div className='caption-blog'>
      As dust settles from the late 2017 crypto-craze, promising blockchain start ups continue to push forward into 2018. Artificial intelligence is perhaps the most sought after technological achievement of our time, and blockchain is fighting to distribute its ability globally. The marriage of these two technologies goes beyond the blockchain tag lines so often found in the crypto asset space. These are complimentary innovations that make sense and have the potential to drive humanity forward.
      <br/>
      <div className='sub-title-blog'>The Problems with AI Today</div>
      <br/>
      Most artificial intelligence operations are sequestered by centralized organizations. These centralized structures are often referred to as walled gardens because many aspects of development and management are held within these operations. This is the plight many blockchain operations aim to solve. But where some blockchain start ups idealize decentralization, some use cases make stronger claims than others. These stem from two aspects: the nature and the power of the technology.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Artificial intelligence has the ability to reshape our world. We need to decide whether it does so on behalf of the corporate entities who can afford to drive that innovation or to distribute it to the people. Blockchain can open the borders of AI development not just for the advancement of the technology, but the betterment of humanity.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <div className='sub-title-blog'>To Detain or Decentralize Data?</div>
      <br/>
      AI applications require data. Lots of it. Whether training a machine learning algorithm or analyzing large quantities of data for specific insights, data is the currency of AI. The value of this data is well understood and there are large entities invested in controlling that data.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      This restricts innovation and application of AI. Without access to this data, more teams that can contribute to progress in AI are left outside, waiting for the owners of that data to come to their own conclusions. It can also cause biases to occur in the analyses of that data, especially if it’s pooling data from a single platform.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Machine learning models do better with more data. In an ecosystem where multiple sources can contribute data, insights on those data improve. A single data source may be subject to biases based on limitations of their sampling. In instances where insights are needed for a specific group or region, that’s fine. But for data that encompasses broad scale, it is insufficient.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Open data sharing contributes to more accurate predictions that are difficult to glean from single sources.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <div className='sub-title-blog'>The Talent & Tech Problem</div>
      <br/>
      Data science is a field that has been trending more and more in recent years. The same entities keen on controlling data also happen to draw top talent. They simply have the money and resources to incentivize data scientists to work on their projects. With the funding and data available to drive innovation, why wouldn’t it be a good thing for AI operations to be siloed so
      <br/>
      <br/>
      It isn’t easy to take cutting edge AI research in academia and translate that into functional tech with real usability. By controlling data and having proprietary (closed source) tech developments remain, walled gardens prevent mass collaboration on difficult problems. This limits the scope of attack for AI challenges that can benefit from global cooperation. Many data scientists are incentivized by challenges and will collaborate with one another to tackle obstacles like implementing AI. To do so behind a walled garden limits the team and tech that can emerge from innovations in AI.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      With a blockchain platform talent is dispersed. Certain large entities can grab top talent, but they cannot monopolize it. Competing organizations will have their own groups of researchers and developers working on similar problems. Outside of the private sector, much of the research in AI stems from the work done in academia. It’s translating much of that work into current platforms and frameworks that poses a problem for AI research.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      By making developments open source, the chance for other minds in the field to develop and continue innovating increases. By not limiting the work to a singular team, access to fresh perspectives and problem solving becomes more readily available. One needs only to browse Github to see the repository of open source projects that developers can work on. Couple that with its 26 million users and the power of community becomes obvious. Much like more data unlocks better predictions, more minds produce better models. 
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <div className='sub-title-blog'>The Power is With the People</div>
      <br/>
      A big question is just how blockchain will provide the power necessary to handle the data requirements of AI. 
      <br/>
      <br/>
      The hardware needed to achieve modern applications of AI is beyond the capability of most. Whether an individual or small/medium sized enterprise, the necessary compute power is simply out of reach. The ability to store and process this data is a major hurdle for anyone outside of these walled gardens. 
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Though no single person can cope with these demands, collectively we are much more capable than any singular operation. This can be done by donating idle compute power which has been used in the past for research projects that lacked the resources to do so on their own. Blockchain allows it to be done in a decentralized way where that power can be used for any number of tasks.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      The bitcoin network has 1,000,000 times the compute power than the world’s largest centralized supercomputer. Those resources secure a network of transactions. What would happen if we aimed that power at today’s AI projects? The ability to process demanding AI tasks isn’t trapped behind walled gardens, it’s with us. Blockchain protocols can create the marketplace necessary to provide both AI problems and solutions in the same marketplace.
      <div className='sub-title-blog'>Blockchain Breaks Barriers</div>
      <br/>
      Perhaps blockchain’s biggest appeal isn’t decentralization. It’s that it can decentralize while remaining open. This is what makes the internet special. Anyone with an internet connection can access the internet and, by and large, roam freely throughout. This has allowed for worldwide collaboration and innovation in areas that would have been difficult if people were restricted in their ability to access colleagues, projects, and ideas across the globe.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      That’s exactly what blockchain brings to AI: an open marketplace for global collaboration in artificial intelligence. With technology this revolutionary and powerful, its evolution ought to be a worldwide endeavor.
