      <div className='title-blog'>Living with Artificial Intelligence</div>
      <div className='caption-blog'>
        For developers and tech junkies, the term AI brings a world of possibilities and exciting challenges to overcome. For many
        others, it is a buzzword that promises to bring about “the next big thing” but what does that world look like? How
        does it change how we live our day to day lives? Are we going to be cyborgs finally?
        <br/>
        <br/> If the thought of artificial intelligence brings about visions of the singularity and glimpses of post-apocalyptic
        cinema scenes, fear not. Artificial general intelligence (AGI) refers to an artificial entity that can accomplish
        the intellectual tasks of a human. It is also referred to as strong AI or full AI.
        <br/>
        <br/> What we have today is specialized AI (also known as applied AI, or “soft” AI) designed to learn how to accomplish
        specific tasks. These tools can revolutionize the way we analyze data and make predictions. These machine learning
        protocols are only able to learn and apply their algorithms in narrow ways. It just so happens that their application
        is incredibly powerful and useful for humanity.
        <br/>
        <br/> Using live data streams and ever-improving AI algorithms, everyday applications of these technologies can not only
        improve decision making, they can make clear predictions of what’s happening now where once we relied on best estimates
        based on what had happened in the past.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <div className='sub-title-blog'>Weather, Climate, & Natural Disasters</div>
        <br/> The source of endless complaints, jokes, and small talk, weather prediction is a notoriously challenging task. The
        degree of unpredictability is met with our best attempts to figure out a simple outcome like whether or not it will
        rain.
        <br/>
        <br/> AI algorithms can take live data fed through weather balloons, stations, and satellites to predict the outcome.
        As more data accumulates and better models emerge, more variables can be incorporated to strengthen those predictions.
        This could lead to better scheduling for jobs that are contingent upon the weather.
        <br/>
        <br/> On larger scales, it could predict the conditions necessary for natural disasters and how they migrate to prepare
        communities and populations for incoming threats. Better machine learning protocols can also aid in our understanding
        of climate change and its geological and economic consequences.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <div className='sub-title-blog'>Stock Prices & Market Behavior</div>
        <br/> One of the first things on everyone’s mind when it comes to prediction is the market. Algorithmic trading is massive
        and refers to the use of mathematical models and programs to execute fast, precise trades based on set criteria.
        <br/>
        <br/> These models suffer from current limitations that can be overcome with the use of machine learning models. While
        current models are restricted by the programmer, AI can adapt to recognize patterns unbeknownst to humans. It is
        able to use massive backlogs of data and updated models to not only adjust to those patterns but test predictions
        live and strengthen those predictions with each iteration.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <div className='sub-title-blog'>Medical Intervention & Athletics</div>
        <br/> There are many applications for machine learning and AI in healthcare. These span beyond research on static data.
        Patients in hospitals might require several instruments to track their vitals. Healthcare professionals use these
        vitals to make judgements on patient care and risks to their condition. Feeding these data through AI protocols can
        strengthen physician predictions and improve their decision-making abilities when it comes to patient care. The old
        saying goes: an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Better predictions ease both the burden on the patient
        as well as potential costs associated with suboptimal insights.
        <br/>
        <br/> This could be used as a preventative measure outside of a clinical setting or even as a factor in outpatient care.
        Data provided by tracking devices like a Fitbit can be fed through algorithms to warn users of indicators for adverse
        health events. This same approach can also be used for optimizing athletic performance by using metabolic markers
        that are streamed from a device during training and matching that to competitive outcomes and using those outputs
        to make better training decision for the athlete.
        <div className='sub-title-blog'>Ride Sharing, Hotel Booking, & Profit Optimization</div>
        <br/> When it comes to carrying people around, companies like Lyft and Uber have revolutionized the transportation industry.
        While interesting blockchain solutions are being conceived for their own operations, their platforms also benefit
        from predictive AI. Based on the region, demand, and various live streaming data, these companies would be able to
        determine the most profitable place for a driver to wait for a new passenger once they’ve dropped off their current
        passenger.
        <br/>
        <br/> Hotels face a difficult problem in booking rooms. The company must do its best to predict volume based on season
        and local events. It has to accommodate groups for events, account for cancellations, and somehow find a way to maximize
        their profits in this chaos.
        <br/>
        <br/> Machine learning algorithms are ideal for these applications where metrics like time, customer volume, and available
        rooms are easily defined criteria. AI can be used to optimize the process and ensure the hotel is being used in the
        most efficient way for the company to earn its best possible return. AI has the power to be applied to myriad business
        models to increase their bottom line.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <div className='sub-title-blog'>Assembly Line of AI</div>
        <br/> Wait a second, we’re going to use AI for AI? Yes! Narrow AI can glean insights on certain data, but what if something
        else needs to make use of those insights? Instead of having a human do that, we could simply relay the outputs of
        one AI protocol to serve as the inputs for the next AI protocol. We’re building an assembly line of machine learning
        protocols capable of going from raw data to combining any number of those insights into more analysis.
        <br/>
        <br/> Any area that requires multi-level analysis could see this assembly line of AI. For instance, image recognition
        AI could be used to diagnose cancer stage from CT and MRI scans. Those outputs could be used in conjunction with
        medical history, vitals, adjuvant therapies (chemotherapy and radiation therapy) to track, interpret, and improve
        the patient’s care and outcome through further AI models. These wouldn’t replace physician interventions but they
        would drastically strengthen their ability to make sound, confident medical decisions.
        <br/>
        <br/> The ability of AI to communicate to one another will revolutionize our interaction with the world. Once trained
        to proficiencies beyond human ability, we can connect these tools to one another for the betterment of humanity.
        <br/>
        <br/> Applications for predictive AI go far beyond the few examples listed here. Any business professional, medical expert,
        athletic coach, manager, parent, and more knows the value of foresight. Being able to anticipate what will happen
        and be ahead of those challenges before they arrive can give a strategic advantage in something like business, but
        it could also save a life in medicine.
        <br/>
        <br/> Creating an AI using marketplace is our vision of not only providing these tools to users, but to open the possibilities
        of predictive AI to the world. To discover just how we’re doing that, follow our journey:
