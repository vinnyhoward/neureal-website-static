                    ask Neureal about the future the same way we ask Google about the present and the past–with the same
                    confidence we have in the results of Google’s algorithms and first page. This limitless ability creates
                    not only the avoidance of bad things, but the ability to be a first-mover–true time travelers who can
                    see different possible futures, make informed decisions to affect the present through actions, and impact
                    the future one decision at a time. Whether users are companies or governments or individuals, actions
                    based on accurate predictions will have profound impacts across every industry, topic, and social good.</p>

                    to climate change, to medical advances. And, of course… Bitcoin prices.</p>

                    be one step ahead in size and accuracy. Bitcoin itself proved the power of community, creating a distributed
                    computing platform that is 1,000,000 times faster than the largest centralized supercomputer in the world.
